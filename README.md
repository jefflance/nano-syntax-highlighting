# Nano Syntax Highlighting

This is a set of nano configuration files for syntax highlightings.

### To get and use these files ##

Put all files in the .nano directory of your home dir:

`$ cd ~`  
`$ git clone https://github.com/jefflance/nano-syntax-highlighting .nano`

Add the required include lines to your .nanorc file.

`$ cat .nano/_loadall.nanorc >> .nanorc`

If you want to disable a syntax highlighting config, just comment out the desired line.
